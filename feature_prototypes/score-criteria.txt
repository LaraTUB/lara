The following criteria are to be used to prioritize issues:

- label
   - critical
   - bug
   - help wanted
- assigned
   - me?
   - noone?
   - somoneone else?
- created by?
   - me?
   - contributer?
   - oganization owner?
- time?
- Milestone? Then check due date

# Pull Requets
- time (older = more important)
- assigned to me?
- issued by?
   - contributer?

At the moment the prioritization functions as follows:

- label
   - critical 100
   - bug 10
   - help wanted 50

The issue-scoring script currently does twofold: It rates issues based on a scoring system, gives an overview of assigned issues (with warning if issues are unassigned) and then can return a list of issues sorted by the rating of the scoring system.
